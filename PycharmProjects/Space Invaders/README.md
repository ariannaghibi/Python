# Space Invaders Gameplay

The game starts with aliens spawning from top of the screen and meteors spawning diagonally. The goal is to shoot as many aliens as possible before the jet explodes. If the jet hits either the aliens or the meteors, the game ends. Each destroyed alien gives the player one point and once the game ends, the highest score will be updated.
