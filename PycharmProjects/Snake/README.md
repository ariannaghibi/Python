# Snake Gameplay

The game starts with a snake head and a food. As the snake eats the food, it'll grow longer. On every three foods being eaten by the snake, three boulders appear on the screen at random locations. If the snake hits either the boulders or the walls, the game ends. Each food gives the player 10 points and once the game ends, the highest score will be updated.
